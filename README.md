# Text-Classification

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model for binary text classification to detect phishing links. Using datasets loaded from Excel files, the model is trained and evaluated using Hugging Face Transformers in a Google Colab environment. Key steps include preprocessing with a BERT tokenizer, freezing base model layers, computing accuracy and AUC metrics, and evaluating performance on test data, achieving high accuracy (87.1%) and AUC (95.3%).
